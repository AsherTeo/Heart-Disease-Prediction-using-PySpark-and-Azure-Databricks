# Overview
In this project, I developed a heart disease prediction model using PySpark and Azure Databricks, leveraging MLlib for training and testing. The project includes building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that covers data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's Heart Disease Prediction, was uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and then accessed by Azure Databricks for further processing. Using PySpark's MLlib, various machine learning algorithms were applied to build a binary classification model. The model was fine-tuned and evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its performance in predicting heart disease.

This project demonstrates a practical application of PySpark and Databricks for large-scale data processing and machine learning model development, from data ingestion to model evaluation.
