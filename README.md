# Overview
In this project, I developed a heart disease prediction model using PySpark and Azure Databricks, leveraging MLlib for training and testing. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

The Kaggle Heart Disease Prediction dataset was uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. For EDA, I converted the data from a Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame for visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
I built a binary classification model using PySpark's MLlib, fine-tuned it with Hyperopt, and evaluated its performance using the F1 score. I also adjusted the classification threshold to optimize the balance between sensitivity and specificity.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in using PySpark and MLlib for machine learning tasks.
