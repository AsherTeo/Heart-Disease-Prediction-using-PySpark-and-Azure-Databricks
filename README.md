# Overview
In this project, I developed a heart disease prediction model using PySpark and Azure Databricks, leveraging MLlib for training and testing. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

The Kaggle Heart Disease Prediction dataset was uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted by converting the dataset from a Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame, which facilitated detailed visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib A binary classification model was built using PySpark's MLlib, followed by fine-tuning with Hyperopt to optimize hyperparameters. The model's performance was evaluated using the F1 score, and the classification threshold was adjusted to enhance the balance between sensitivity and specificity.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in using PySpark and MLlib for machine learning tasks.
